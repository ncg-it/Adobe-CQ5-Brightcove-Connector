    ==================
    ABOUT THIS PROJECT
    ==================

    This project is intended to work with Adobe CQ 5.5 and above.

    This project was generated from the com.cqblueprints.archetypes:multi-module Maven Archetype.

    More information on the generation process can be found here:

    http://www.cqblueprints.com/xwiki/bin/view/Blue+Prints/The+CQ+Project+Maven+Archetype




    ================
    BUILD AND DEPLOY
    ================

    To build this project you will need access to the Adobe Maven Repository and also the CQ Blueprints Maven
    Repository:

    - Connecting to the CQ Blueprints Maven Repository
      http://www.cqblueprints.com/xwiki/bin/view/Blue+Prints/Connecting+to+the+CQ+Blueprints+Repository

    - Connecting to the Adobe Maven Repository
      http://www.cqblueprints.com/xwiki/bin/view/Blue+Prints/Connecting+to+the+Adobe+Maven+Repository

    Once the repositories are added to your maven configuration file, you can execute the following steps:

    1) Clean previously generated files
       $ mvn clean

    2) Edit the pom.xml file instance configuration:
       ...
       <cq.host>172.16.91.137</cq.host>
       <cq.port>4502</cq.port>
       <cq.user>admin</cq.user>
       <cq.password>admin</cq.password>
       ...

    3) Edit the configuration parameters under the brightcove-config/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/brightcove/runmodes

    4) Build and deploy the project

       IMPORTANT: due to an issue with the 2.1.0 version of the maven-sling-plugin, the path specified by the
       slingUrlSuffix parameter in the brightcove-services pom.xml file will not be created automatically and so must
       already exist in your CQ instance BEFORE trying to use the auto-deploy profile:

       - Using CRXDE Lite: create /apps/brightcove/install
       - Using CURL:
         $ curl -uadmin:admin 'http://localhost:4502/crx/server/crx.default/jcr%3aroot' -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=crxde' -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest' --data-binary $'--crxde\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=":diff"\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\r\n\r\n+/apps/brightcove : {"jcr:primaryType":"nt:folder"}\r\n+/apps/brightcove/install : {"jcr:primaryType":"nt:folder"}\r\n--crxde-- ' --compressed


       $ mvn -Pauto-deploy install
